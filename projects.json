      "description": "Challenges faced by mothers before birth, such as stress and infections, can influence a child’s cognitive development. This happens through the transfer of maternal substances to the foetus, including immune cells, impacting not only immediate brain development but potentially influencing brain function across generations.",

      "description": "Mothers pass immune cells to their babies during pregnancy, enhancing fetal immune development and providing protection against infections in early life. Higher numbers of these maternal immune cells correlate with increased resilience against infections, shedding light on a new dimension of maternal-fetal immune transfer that goes beyond antibodies, potentially influencing the newborn’s health and immunity.",

These cells unique markers, regulate microglia (brain immune cells), and contribute to the maturation of neural circuits, ultimately influencing lifelong brain functions and behaviour. This reveals that the transfer of these cells is not just a byproduct of pregnancy but are active participants in creating a foundation for optimal brain health.",

Focusing on infants at 7 months after birth, we found increased mantel depressive symptoms associated with infants experiencing more sleeping and crying issues, indicating potential long-term effects.",
